Unlike **feed-forward** neural networks which means that all our data is fed forwards (all at once) from left to right through the network. After all, even we (humans) don't process text all at once. We read word by word from left to right and keep track of the current meaning of the sentence so we can understand the meaning of the next word. Well this is exaclty what a recurrent neural network is designed to do. When we say recurrent neural network all we really mean is a network that contains a loop. An RNN will process one word at a time while maintaining an internal memory of what it's already seen. This will allow it to treat words differently based on their order in a sentence and to slowly build an understanding of the entire input, one word at a time.\n","\n","This is why we are treating our text data as a sequence!

However, there does exist some other recurrent layers (layers that contain a loop) that work much better than a simple RNN layer. The one we will talk about here is called LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory). This layer works very similarily to the simpleRNN layer but adds a way to access inputs from any timestep in the past. Whereas in our simple RNN layer input from previous timestamps gradually disappeared as we got further through the input. With a LSTM we have a long-term memory data structure storing all the previously seen inputs as well as when we saw them. This allows for us to access any previous value we want at any point in time. This adds to the complexity of our network and allows it to discover more useful relationships between inputs and when they appear. \n","\n","For the purpose of this course we will refrain from going any further into the math or details behind how these layers work.\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"rLy8ubEjT5B0","colab_type":"text"},"source":["##Sentiment Analysis\n","And now time to see a recurrent neural network in action.
